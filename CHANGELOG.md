# Changelog

## 3.2.0

- `ste_check.py --profile writing`: a rule set for scientific and grant prose written to a style guide that keeps closed em-dashes, uses "However", "Thus" and "Crucially" as connectives, wants varied sentence length, and writes Methods in the passive. It keeps the AI-tell checks and semicolons, raises the sentence limit to 55 words, drops the STE structure checks and the plain-vocabulary swaps that change meaning in technical prose ("identical", "whether", "verify", "determine", "indicate"), and stops at a References heading. The default profile (`ste80`) is unchanged.
- The sentence splitter now starts a new sentence at an opening `[` (both profiles).

## 3.1.0

- Renamed from `humanizer-ste80` to `ste80-humanizer` ("STE80 Humanizer"). Install with `npx skills add Dodaios/ste80-humanizer`. The slash command is now `/ste80-humanizer`.

## 3.0.0

- Rewrote SKILL.md from top to bottom for readability.
- New section "How to read this skill": two passes, §1 to §26 for AI tells, S1 to S15 for structure, the same fields in every entry.
- New section "The method": Karpathy's full tip, the ladder from writing to diagrams, HTML and video, why STE works on LLMs, a table of what 100% and 80% mean, and a note on errors in the graphic that came with his post.
- Pass 1 now covers all 26 patterns of blader/humanizer in the same order (adds hyphenated pairs, vague association, repeated heading, borrowed authority with prestige lists, and others), each with Watch for, Problem, and new Before/After examples. The MIT notice of blader/humanizer is in LICENSE.
- Pass 2 has 15 S-rules, each with 80% and Strict levels and examples.
- New worked example that shows the text after Pass 1 and after Pass 2.
- Return formats now include file mode, embedded mode and review mode.

## 2.0.0

- Renamed from `ste80` to `humanizer-ste80`. The skill is now a general humanizer that uses STE80 as its method.
- New Part 1: 23 AI tells in five groups (staging, rhythm, inflation, formatting, chat residue), inspired by Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" and blader/humanizer.
- Part 2: the 23 STE80 structure rules, now in compact form. The full rules with before and after examples moved to `references/ste80-rules.md`.
- New modes: Humanize (default), Light, Strict STE.
- New sections: Voice (match a writing sample), "Human quirks" to keep, contradiction flag in the fidelity rules.
- `ste_check.py` now also flags AI tells: not-X-but-Y, chatbot openers and closers, run-ups, fake depth, stacked hedges, vague authority, "-ing" riders, inflated significance and curly quotes.
- New eval case: `humanize-linkedin-post`.

## 1.0.0

- First release.
- 80% mode (default) and strict mode.
- 23 rules in six groups (sentences, verbs, words, structure, punctuation, what 80% relaxes), with before and after examples.
- Fidelity rules: keep every fact, keep uncertainty at its strength, add nothing.
- `references/word-swaps.md`: plain alternatives in ten groups, including typical LLM vocabulary.
- `references/strict-mode.md`: paraphrased ASD-STE100 Issue 9 rule sections and a final checklist.
- `scripts/ste_check.py`: dependency-free heuristic linter.
